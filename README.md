### A tutorial on my machine-learning workflow for predicting whether or not this post will be popular


Dear Reader,

The purpose of the notebook is simple: describe my efforts in building a machine learning model.

I posted an article on /r/datascience subreddit to test its predictive power.  

In this one instance I say that it worked as it was built for. As of today, 2/13/2018 at 7:38am EST it has received 18 votes. It might not seem like a lot of votes, but you have to take into consideration that unpopular posts in the /r/datascience subreddit receive on average 2 votes

Most excitingly, I even have controls for this experiment. This model was built specifically for /r/datascience. I cross-posted this article on /r/python and /r/machine and received 0 and 1 votes respectively. oh yeah!

I know that I need more controls, more posts and a better f1 score but I am very optimistic
